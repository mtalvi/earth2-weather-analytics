The Earth-2 Weather Analytics Blueprint is a reference implementation of a geospatial
data analysis service comprised of multiple features from NVIDIA's Earth-2 platform.
This repository provides a starting point for you to build your
own weather / climate systems accelerated by AI and Omniverse.
This blueprint will demonstrate the following core features and their integration to
create a complete weather analytics service:

1. Using the Nvidia Omniverse platform to aggregate and visualize data at scale
1. Deploying and scaling AI weather models through
   *[Nvidia Inference Microservices](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/index.html#earth-2)
   (NIMs)*
1. Using components of the Nvidia Earth-2 platform to implement an adapter framework
   that connects to partner and public data stores

## Core Components

- *Earth-2 Command Center (E2CC)*: An Omniverse Kit application with extensions that
  enable visualization of geo-spatial data. This is the front-end of the blueprint.
- *Data Federation Mesh (DFM)*: Glue code or orchestration layer that processes
  pipelines from different data stores. Connects the different data sources to E2CC and
  runs the needed pipelines to generate textures.
- *FourCastNet NIM (FCN NIM)*: An AI weather model, packaged as an Nvidia Inference
  Microservice, for global weather forecasting.

## Getting Started

This repository is specifically designed for developers.
Follow these steps to clone the repository:

```bash
git lfs install

git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA-Omniverse-blueprints/earth2-weather-analytics.git
cd earth2-weather-analytics

# just in case
git lfs fetch --all
```

Use the blueprint guide to build and deploy the blueprint on your infrastructure.
This guide requires intermediate knowledge of Python, Docker,
and beginner knowledge of Kubernetes / Helm Charts.

## OpenShift Deployment

The Helm chart includes built-in support for Red Hat OpenShift, gated behind an
`openshift.enabled` flag that defaults to `false`.  When enabled via the
provided `values-openshift.yaml` overlay, the chart creates OpenShift Routes for
external access and SCC RoleBindings for container security.  FourCastNet can
optionally be deployed through the NIM Operator (NIMCache + NIMService) instead
of a raw Deployment.

```bash
helm install earth2-weather-analytics deploy/helm/ \
  -f deploy/helm/values.yaml \
  -f deploy/helm/values-openshift.yaml \
  -n earth2
```
